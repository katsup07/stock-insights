🧠 Design Philosophy
✅ Plain English, not finance jargon

✅ Mobile-friendly, responsive

✅ Color-coded indicators (green = growth, red = decline)

✅ Explainers/tooltips next to each section

✅ No overwhelming data — simplicity > complexity

🗺️ Development Roadmap
🔹 Phase 1: Basic App Skeleton (MVP)
📌 Frontend
 Set up React + Tailwind project

 Build basic layout with navbar, stock search, and chart area

 Implement Recharts with mocked historical data

 Create selectable timeframes (1M, 6M, 1Y, 5Y)

 Add dummy AI commentary box

📌 Backend
 Set up NestJS server

 Endpoint: GET /api/stocks/:ticker

Fetches data from Alpha Vantage

Normalizes data (e.g., date + close price array)

 Return mock prediction + summary (stub for now)

🔹 Phase 2: Add Real Data
📌 Frontend
 Call backend with ticker input

 Display real historical data on Recharts

 Highlight key data points (peaks/dips)

📌 Backend
 Alpha Vantage integration (daily/weekly data)

 Format response to match frontend needs:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "prices": [{ "date": "2024-01-01", "close": 150.5 }, ...]
}
🔹 Phase 3: Add Prediction
📌 Backend
 Create Python ML microservice (Flask/FastAPI)

 Time-series prediction with ARIMA or Prophet

 NestJS calls Python service: GET /predict?ticker=AAPL

 Return predictions with confidence intervals

📌 Frontend
 Overlay prediction as shaded area in Recharts

 Toggle visibility of prediction

🔹 Phase 4: AI Commentary
📌 Backend
 Use OpenAI API

 Pass in latest trends + model result

 Return simplified summary (e.g.):

“AAPL has grown steadily since March. Expect moderate volatility due to earnings season.”

📌 Frontend
 Display commentary below chart

 Add explainer for “How is this summary generated?”

🔹 Phase 5 (Optional Features)
 Watchlist/favorites with localStorage or simple backend DB

 Alerts (via email or notifications)

 Portfolio simulator

 Education tooltips (e.g., “What’s a moving average?”)
